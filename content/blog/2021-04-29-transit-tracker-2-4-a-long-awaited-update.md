It's been a long time since the last Transit Tracker update. Why? Because each update has previously been so difficult, with a broad range of problems : user not getting the update, server crashing, long downtime during update, etc. Transit Tracker is a complicated app, it handle so much information from about thirty agencies *each minute*. That's a lot. And after that, it has to distribute all this information to all users in a matter of seconds.

With this update, and to make everything more simple, Transit Tracker is now two applications : the frontend, where the users see the data, and the backend, when the data is produced. In order to make this transition, the entire frontend had to be rewritten, which took a lot of time. But it will allow much more faster update in the future. Along with this transition, a number of new features has been added:

## Updated interface and user experience

Almost all parts of the application has been revisited, here are some changes that you will proba

## Easier than never to get started

Previously, new users had to take configure the application before being able to use it. Now, they can just dive right in the application!
